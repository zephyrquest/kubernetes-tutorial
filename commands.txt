kubectl get node

# ConfigMap and Secret must exist before Deployments.
# kubectl apply -f <file-name.yaml> -> apply manages applications through files defining K8s resources.
kubectl apply -f mongo-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml

# crete first database because the application depends on it.
kubectl apply -f mongo.yaml # deployment and service are created

# deploy the web application.
kubectl apply -f webapp.yaml

# get all components created in the cluster (deployment, pods, services)
kubectl get all

kubectl get configmap
kubectl get secret

kubectl describe service webapp-service

kubectl logs <podName>

# get the services (to see their IPs)
kubectl get svc
# the ports of the webapp-service are 3000:30100/TCP

# how to access the service from the browser? We need the IP of the Cluster Node. In this case there is only one Node, which is minikube.
# get IP address of minikube
minikube ip OR kubectl get node -o wide

# if the IP of the Cluster Node is 192.168.49.2 and the port of the app Service is 30100, you could open the app with the browser at 192.168.49.2:30100

# this fix the problem where the app cannot be opened using the ip and port above
minikube service webapp-service --url
